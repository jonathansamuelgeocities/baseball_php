Hello and Welcome to Dotgeek ! :-)

For RUBY Apps (e.g. Camping, Sinatra)
=====================================

Drop your config.ru file inside this www folder and the relevant images,
css etc. in the /public folder. Do not remove the tmp dir as this is used 
to restart your application.

For PHP
=======
To run PHP scripts alongside with ruby simply drop them in the /public
folder but *don't forget to rename or remove  the config.ru* file in your folder else
our default Ruby placeholder app will load.


FOR PERL
========
To run Perl Dancer apps simply drop your app in the folder /perl/bin/ to
replace the sample app.pl that is already running in your webspace
at yourname.1.ai/perl
The default url of your dancer app will be yourname.1.ai/perl
